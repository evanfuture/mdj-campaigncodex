# Where does your story begin?

Every good tale needs a lead in and this is where it all starts. From banners to smaller pieces of lore that get woven into a narrative for whatever your doing, Midjourney is able to help you set tone and style early for anyone you are sharing your stories with.

##One Great Tale

Generally for a lead in piece you can if you want blend together other map elements with character or symbology. Midjourney can through a few iterations help you arrive at a set of **evocative** (keep that in mind for later) images that will help sell or tell your tale.

In this example for the **One Great Tale** image above the command for generating it included the following elements as an example,

> /imagine prompt: [ IMG1 ] [ IMG2 ] province map of dragon nation borders and kingdoms and creatures, 2D, full render, greens and yellow-grey, 1980 x 1080, photorealistic drawing, sharp focus

This is more of what would be considered a "standard" midjourney prompt, with nothing very strange about it as well as no pre-queuing of any image-URL in the prompt to help the system in it's initial generation. Instead this focuses on a few parts, which are the _basics_ that this Codex assumes you will understand from the [MidJourney Command Reference](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/imagine-parameters).

This **Text Prompt** includes a few portions which try to encourage specific _style_ choices for our image, while being rather generic otherwise.
