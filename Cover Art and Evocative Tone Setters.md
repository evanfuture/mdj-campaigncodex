# Where does your story begin?

Every good tale needs a lead in and this is where it all starts. From banners to smaller pieces of lore that get woven into a narrative for whatever your doing, Midjourney is able to help you set tone and style early for anyone you are sharing your stories with.

Generally for a lead in piece you can if you want blend together other map elements with character or symbology. Midjourney can through a few iterations help you arrive at a set of **evocative** (keep that in mind for later) images that will help sell or tell your tale.
