# Where does your story begin?

Every good tale needs a lead in and this is where it all starts. From banners to smaller pieces of lore that get woven into a narrative for whatever your doing, Midjourney is able to help you set tone and style early for anyone you are sharing your stories with.

## One Great Tale

Generally for a lead in piece you can if you want blend together other map elements with character or symbology. Midjourney can through a few iterations help you arrive at a set of **evocative** (keep that in mind for later) images that will help sell or tell your tale.

In this example for the **One Great Tale** image above the command for generating it included the following elements as an example,

> **/imagine prompt:** [ IMG1 ] [ IMG2 ] province map of dragon nation borders and kingdoms and creatures, 2D, full render, greens and yellow-grey, 1980 x 1080, photorealistic drawing, sharp focus
NOTE: IMG1, IMG2 removed for example simplicity.

While this image uses two image prompts, the rest is an example of the type of prompt that can lead to useful results for your storytelling. The prompt above is an example of others you will see in this Codex, which assumes you will understand the [MidJourney Command Reference](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/imagine-parameters).

This **Text Prompt** includes a few portions which try to encourage specific _style_ choices for our image, while being rather generic otherwise. But more on that in other sections.

## Banners and Embelishments

You could feed your prompt an [ IMG1 ] URL reference such as this banner,

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4333299/204849680-40460835-9ffb-4cef-83c3-f3e5ba61b58c.png" width="25%">

as well as other seed elements, like this dragon (which was used in **The Great Tale** image above). This image was what allowed the top-of-the-waves (low detail but enough to capture a viewers interest) in the output image.

An example of doing so shows that Midjourney is not able at this time (V4) to retain stability to your original source image, but will leverage it for derivative (hybridized) results. In this example, the two images were added as reference and a simple prompt to add banner information was used as a way to create options for different "front page" views or variants.

> imagine prompt: [ url1 ] [ url2] add banner icons
