## Multi-Portion Map Seeds

A single map is great, but complicated maps or scenes within scenes can be better. Midjourney can support this, but it requires some work and experimentation. Below is an example of how this method works for seeding creative prompts with enough help to get to stylistic results like the image below.

### The Method for Seeding Multi-Portion Maps
 
1. Assist Midjourney with low complexity images to add shape references.
  * Midjourney won't innately react to prompts about things like picture-in-picture. Instead, you'll have to get lucky on a --chaos roll, or apply the following solution.
