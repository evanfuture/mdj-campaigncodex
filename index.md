# Midjourney Campaign Codex from the MJ Cartographers Guild
The guide that follows are some captured and reshared recommendations to creators, gamers or designers working within Midjourney for creation or curation of content for their gaming tables or just because maps are great. We are a map-focused group and the content here won't generally dive down too many other rabbit holes unless the community interest emerges into new sub-sections, but with luck you can leverage this guide to improve the thematic elements that lend to creative storytelling.
